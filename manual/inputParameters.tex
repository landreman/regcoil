\section{General parameters}

\param{general\_option}
{integer}
{1}
{Always}
{Determines the overall flow of program execution.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 1: Compute the current potential for a range of $\lambda$.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 2: Do not compute the current potential, but rather load the current potential computed
by \nescoil~in the file \parlink{nescout\_filename}, compute the $\chi^2_B$ and $\chi^2_K$ for it,
and save results. For this setting, \parlink{Nlambda} will be over-written with the number of
current potential solutions found in the nescout file.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 3: Emulate \nescoil's truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) solver.
The least-squares problem solved will be minimization of only $\chi^2_B$ (i.e. $\lambda=0$.)
Output quantities will be saved in the same arrays as if $\lambda$ were scanned.
For this setting, \parlink{Nlambda} will be over-written with the number of
singular values.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 4: Search for a value of the regularization weight such that
a certain target is met. The target is chosen using \parlink{target\_option}.
Use this value of {\ttfamily general\_option} for running \regcoil~inside
a fixed-boundary plasma shape optimization, in which case {\ttfamily chi2\_B\_target}
is the objective function you should minimize in the optimization.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 5: Same as 4, except that before the $\lambda$ search is carried out,
the system is solved
for $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=\infty$ to check whether the current density target is attainable.
Thus, this option takes a little more time than {\ttfamily general\_option}=4 but is more robust.
}

\myhrule

\param{regularization\_term\_option}
{string}
{{\ttfamily "chi2\_K"}}
{Always}
{Determines which term is used for regularization.\\

{\ttfamily regularization\_term\_option = "chi2\_K"}: Use $\chi^2_K$ as the regularization term, as described in the Nuclear Fusion paper.\\

{\ttfamily regularization\_term\_option = "Laplace-Beltrami"}: Use $\int d^2a (\nabla^2 \Phi)^2$ as the regularization term, where the integral is 
performed over the coil surface, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

\param{nescout\_filename}
{string}

\myhrule

\param{symmetry\_option}
{integer}
{1}
{Always}
{Determines whether stellarator symmetry is imposed.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 1: Force the single-valued part of the current potential
to be odd in $\theta$ and $\zeta$. This option corresponds to stellarator symmetry.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 2: Force the single-valued part of the current potential
to be even in $\theta$ and $\zeta$. I'm not sure why you would ever use this option,
but it is available for completeness.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 3: No symmetry in the current potential is imposed.
}

\myhrule

\param{save\_level}
{integer}
{3}
{Always}
{Option related determining how many variables are saved in the \netCDF~output file.  The larger the value, the smaller the output file.\\

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 0: Save everything.\\

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 1: Do not save the inductance matrix.\\

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 2: Also do not save the matrix $g$.\\

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 3: Also do not save the normal vector or derivatives of the position vector.
}

\myhrule

\param{load\_bnorm}
{logical}
{\false}
{When \parlink{general\_option}=1 or 3.}
{Whether or not an output file from the \bnorm~code is to be loaded.
Set this option to \true~if there is significant current in the plasma,
meaning the coils will need to cancel the associated magnetic field component normal
to the target plasma surface.

plasma surface associated with current inside the plasma.}

\myhrule

\param{net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes}
{real}
{1.0}
{If \parlink{geometry\_option\_plasma}=0,1, 5 or 7, i.e. if the plasma surface is not a vmec equilibrium.}
{The number of Amperes of current the links the coil winding surface poloidally,
denoted $G$ in \cite{regcoilPaper}. If the plasma surface is obtained from a vmec equilibrium,
then {\ttfamily net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes} will be determined instead
from the {\ttfamily bvco} value in the vmec wout file.
}

\myhrule

\param{net\_toroidal\_current\_Amperes}
{real}

denoted $I$ in \cite{regcoilPaper}. Unlike the net poloidal current, this number
is never read from a wout file.
}



\section{Resolution parameters}

For any new set of surface geometries you consider, you should vary the resolution parameters in this section to make sure
they are large enough.  These parameters should be large enough that the code results you care about are unchanged under further
resolution increases.

when transforming from the original poloidal angle to the straight-field-line angle.

more modes are required in any other coordinate.
